            <p>My name is Talia, and I am an artist, reader and computer nerd! I play Dungeons and Dragons, and most of my art is 
                to do with that. I post most of it on instagram @Velossoraptor. I love to crochet, and do all sorts of crafts
                along with everything to do with computers! (I don't currently have a picture of myself available on this computer,
                so hopefully this drawing will suffice for now!)
