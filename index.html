                <p>My name is Talia, and I am an artist, reader and computer nerd! I play Dungeons and Dragons, and most of my art is 
                    to do with that. I post most of it on instagram @Velossoraptor. I love to crochet, and do all sorts of crafts
                    along with everything to do with computers! (I don't currently have a picture of myself available on this computer,
                    so hopefully this drawing will suffice for now!) Here is more random info to fill the page, I dont know what to say 
                    that makes any more sense, random words, blah blah blah, askldjga ksdkfjslkjglsk jflksdhklsj. This is not very professional,
                    but I dont know what to write :( Still is not filling up as much as I'd like, so I'm gonna keep writing until I 
                    decide the page looks nice i suppose. Uhhhh I like to use gouache which is something new I figured out, just got a palette 
                    as a gift, and was experimenting with it which was fun. One of my favourite movies is WallE.

                <p>Canada is very snowy in the winter, and very humid and hot in the summer. We get beautiful snow and lots of wildlife in the country.</p>
